# Ken Davis

I help businesses get their existing systems working properly by optimizing workflows and streamlining processes.

## What I Do

I run [Lodgepole I/O](https://lodgepole.io), specializing in workflow design and operational systems. My approach: **optimize first, automate second**. Most businesses don't need another tool—they need their existing systems to actually work.

### Core Services
- Airtable base design and forensic cleanup
- n8n workflow automation
- Process optimization and system design

I do the detective work: listen to how teams actually operate, find where things break down, then systematically clean up the mess before layering in automation.

## Tech I Work With
- **Databases**: Airtable (primary), relational database design
- **Automation**: n8n, Make, Airtable scripting
- **Integration**: APIs, webhooks, custom scripting
- **Front-end**: Basic React/web development

## Side Projects
- **[mirlo.photo](https://mirlo.photo)** - Privacy-focused photo sharing platform I built as an alternative to Facebook/Instagram
- Various automation templates and workflow tools (see pinned repos)
